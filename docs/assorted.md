# Detailed commands for dev testing, dependencies, GitHub actions, sentry, cellery, redis ++

### Testing

`make test`

Will run django tests using `--keepdb` and `--parallel`. You may pass a path to the desired test module in the make command. E.g.:

`make test someapp.tests.test_views`

### Adding new pypi libs

To add a new **backend** dependency, run `poetry add {dependency}`. If the dependency should be only available for development user append `-G dev` to the command.

### API Schema and Client generation

We use the [`DRF-Spectacular`](https://drf-spectacular.readthedocs.io/en/latest/readme.html) tool to generate an OpenAPI schema from our Django Rest Framework API. The OpenAPI schema serves as the backbone for generating client code, creating comprehensive API documentation, and more.

The API documentation pages are accessible at `http://localhost:8000/api/schema/swagger-ui/` or `http://localhost:8000/api/schema/redoc/`.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Anytime a view is created, updated, or removed, the schema must be updated to reflect the changes. Failing to do so can lead to outdated client code or documentation.
>
> To update the schema, run:
> - If you are using Docker: `make docker_backend_update_schema`
> - If you are not using Docker: `poetry run python manage.py spectacular --color --file schema.yml`

We use the [`openapi-ts`](https://heyapi.vercel.app/openapi-ts/get-started.html) tool to generate TypeScript client code from the OpenAPI schema. The generated client code is used to interact with the API in a type-safe manner.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Anytime the API schema is updated, the client code must be regenerated to reflect the changes. Failing to do so can lead to type errors in the client code.
>
> To update the client code, run:
> - If you are using Docker: `make docker_frontend_update_api`
> - If you are not using Docker: `npm run openapi-ts`

> [!NOTE]
> If `pre-commit` is properly enabled, it will automatically update both schema and client before each commit whenever necessary.

## Github Actions

To enable Continuous Integration through Github Actions, we provide a `proj_main.yml` file. To connect it to Github you need to rename it to `main.yml` and move it to the `.github/workflows/` directory.

You can do it with the following commands:

```bash
mkdir -p .github/workflows
mv proj_main.yml .github/workflows/main.yml
```

## Production Deployment

### Setup

This project comes with an `render.yaml` file, which can be used to create an app on Render.com from a GitHub repository.

Before deploying, please make sure you've generated an up-to-date `poetry.lock` file containing the Python dependencies. This is necessary even if you've used Docker for local runs. Do so by following [these instructions](#setup-the-backend-app).

After setting up the project, you can init a repository and push it on GitHub. If your repository is public, you can use the following button:

[![Deploy to Render](https://render.com/images/deploy-to-render-button.svg)](https://render.com/deploy)

If you are in a private repository, access the following link replacing `$YOUR_REPOSITORY_URL$` with your repository link.

-   `https://render.com/deploy?repo=$YOUR_REPOSITORY_URL$`

Keep reading to learn how to configure the prompted environment variables.

#### `ALLOWED_HOSTS`

Chances are your project name isn't unique in Render, and you'll get a randomized suffix as your full app URL like: `https://CDP_Trondheim_Kommune-a1b2.onrender.com`.

But this will only happen after the first deploy, so you are not able to properly fill `ALLOWED_HOSTS` yet. Simply set it to `*` then fix it later to something like `CDP_Trondheim_Kommune-a1b2.onrender.com` and your domain name like `example.org`.

#### `ENABLE_DJANGO_COLLECTSTATIC`

Default is 1, meaning the build script will run collectstatic during deploys.

#### `AUTO_MIGRATE`

Default is 1, meaning the build script will run collectstatic during deploys.

#### `SECRET_KEY`

Django requires a SECRET_KEY that is at least 50 characters long and with enough randomness. Render’s `generateValue: true` produces a shorter value (about 44 characters) that does not meet Django’s security check, so it fails with `security.W009`.

The correct approach is to declare the variable with `sync: false`. That way, the `SECRET_KEY` is not stored in the repository, and the first time the Blueprint is created, Render will prompt you to provide the secret value manually. This ensures the key is long, random, and secure while keeping it outside version control.

You can generate a new key by running the following command on your local machine:

```bash
python -c "from django.core.management.utils import get_random_secret_key; print(get_random_secret_key())"
```

### Build script

By default, the project will always run the `render_build.sh` script during deployments. This script does the following:

1.  Build the frontend
2.  Build the backend
3.  Run Django checks
4.  Run `collectstatic`
5.  Run Django migrations
6.  Push frontend source maps to Sentry

### Celery

As there aren't free plans for Workers in Render.com, the configuration for Celery workers/beat will be commented by default in the `render.yaml`. This means celery won't be available by default.

Uncommenting the worker configuration lines on `render.yaml` will imply in costs.

### SendGrid

To enable sending emails from your application you'll need to have a valid SendGrid account and also a valid verified sender identity. After finishing the validation process you'll be able to generate the API credentials and define the `SENDGRID_USERNAME` and `SENDGRID_PASSWORD` environment variables on Render.com.

These variables are required for your application to work on Render.com since it's pre-configured to automatically email admins when the application is unable to handle errors gracefully.

### Media storage

Media files integration with S3 or similar is not supported yet. Please feel free to contribute!

### Sentry

[Sentry](https://sentry.io) is already set up on the project. For production, add `SENTRY_DSN` environment variable on Render.com, with your Sentry DSN as the value.

You can test your Sentry configuration by deploying the boilerplate with the sample page and clicking on the corresponding button.

### Sentry source maps for JS files

The `render_build.sh` script has a step to push Javascript source maps to Sentry, however some environment variables need to be set on Render.com.

The environment variables that need to be set are:

-   `SENTRY_ORG` - Name of the Sentry Organization that owns your Sentry Project.
-   `SENTRY_PROJECT_NAME` - Name of the Sentry Project.
-   `SENTRY_API_KEY` - Sentry API key that needs to be generated on Sentry. [You can find or create authentication tokens within Sentry](https://sentry.io/api/).

After enabling dyno metadata and setting the environment variables, your next Render.com Deploys will create a release on Sentry where the release name is the commit SHA, and it will push the source maps to it.

## Linting

-   At pre-commit time (see below)
-   Manually with `poetry run ruff` and `npm run lint` on project root.
-   During development with an editor compatible with ruff and ESLint.

## Pre-commit hooks

### If you are using Docker:

-   Not supported yet. Please feel free to contribute!

### If you are not using Docker:

-   On project root, run `poetry run pre-commit install` to enable the hook into your git repo. The hook will run automatically for each commit.

## Opinionated Settings

Some settings defaults were decided based on Vinta's experiences. Here's the rationale behind them:

### `DATABASES["default"]["ATOMIC_REQUESTS"] = True`

- Using atomic requests in production prevents several database consistency issues. Check [Django docs for more details](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.0/topics/db/transactions/#tying-transactions-to-http-requests).

- **Important:** When you are queueing a new Celery task directly from a Django view, particularly with little or no delay/ETA, it is essential to use `transaction.on_commit(lambda: my_task.delay())`. This ensures that the task is only queued after the associated database transaction has been successfully committed.
  - If `transaction.on_commit` is not utilized, or if a significant delay is not set, you risk encountering race conditions. In such scenarios, the Celery task might execute before the completion of the request's transaction. This can lead to inconsistencies and unexpected behavior, as the task might operate on a database state that does not yet reflect the changes made in the transaction. Read more about this problem on [this article](https://www.vinta.com.br/blog/database-concurrency-in-django-the-right-way).

### `CELERY_TASK_ACKS_LATE = True`

- We believe Celery tasks should be idempotent. So for us it's safe to set `CELERY_TASK_ACKS_LATE = True` to ensure tasks will be re-queued after a worker failure. Check Celery docs on ["Should I use retry or acks_late?"](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/stable/faq.html#faq-acks-late-vs-retry) for more info.

### Django-CSP

Django-CSP helps implementing Content Security Policy (CSP) in Django projects to mitigate cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks by declaring which dynamic resources are allowed to load.

In this project, we have defined several CSP settings that define the sources from which different types of resources can be loaded. If you need to load external images, fonts, or other resources, you will need to add the sources to the corresponding CSP settings. For example:
- To load scripts from an external source, such as https://browser.sentry-cdn.com, you would add this source to `CSP_SCRIPT_SRC`.
- To load images from an external source, such as https://example.com, you would add this source to `CSP_IMG_SRC`.

Please note that you should only add trusted sources to these settings to maintain the security of your site. For more details, please refer to the [Django-CSP documentation](https://django-csp.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
