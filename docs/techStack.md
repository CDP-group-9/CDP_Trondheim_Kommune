## About

A [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) project boilerplate/template with a multitude of state-of-the-art libraries and tools. If pairing Django with React is a possibility for your project or spinoff, this is the best solution available. Save time with tools like:

-   [React](https://react.dev/), for building interactive UIs
-   [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), for static type checking
-   [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/), for managing the environment and its dependencies
-   [django-js-reverse](https://github.com/vintasoftware/django-js-reverse), for generating URLs on JS
-   [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/), for responsive styling
-   [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/), for bundling static assets
-   [Celery](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/stable/), for background worker tasks
-   [WhiteNoise](https://whitenoise.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) with [brotlipy](https://github.com/python-hyper/brotlicffi), for efficient static files serving
-   [ruff](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff) and [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) with [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) for automated quality assurance (does not replace proper testing!)

For continuous integration, a [Github Action](https://github.com/features/actions) configuration `.github/workflows/main.yml` is included.

Also, includes a Render.com `render.yaml` and a working Django `production.py` settings, enabling easy deployments with ['Deploy to Render' button](https://render.com/docs/deploy-to-render). The `render.yaml` includes the following:

-   PostgreSQL, for DB
-   Redis, for Celery
